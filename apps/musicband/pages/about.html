            Undisputed masters of murderous riffs, pugnacious grooves and
            ferocious hooks since 1991, Machine Head are long established as one
            of the most influential and incendiary bands in the metal world.
            Exploding into the world’s consciousness with 1994’s seminal Burn My
            Eyes album, the now legendary Oakland crew brutishly redefined what
            it meant to be heavy, incorporating a wild array of influences into
            some of the sharpest and most brutal metal anthems ever written.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nearly three decades later, the band founded and led by
            vocalist/guitarist Robb Flynn on Oct 12, 1991 at a Metallica
            concert, (at the end of a 7 year, 3 1/2 album stint as lead
            guitarist in thrash metal pioneers Forbidden and Vio-Lence) has
            amassed an extraordinary catalogue of classic albums – including the
            all-conquering might of 2007’s The Blackening, which saw the band
            traverse the globe several times as headliners and as main support
            to both Metallica and Slipknot - while routinely enhancing an
            already formidable reputation as one of heavy music’s most powerful
            and relentless live bands.

            In 2022, Machine Head are back with their most crushing and complete
            album yet. Of Kingdom And Crown is an hour-long conceptual monolith,
            rich in colour and dynamics but hell-bent on destruction. Set in a
            futuristic wasteland where the sky is always crimson red, Of Kingdom
            And Crown tells the tale of two characters, both faced with
            incalculable trauma, whose stories become bloodily entwined as this
            deep, dark record progresses. Character #1 loses the love of his
            life and goes on a murderous rampage against the perpetrators who
            murdered her. Character #2 loses his mother to a drug overdose and
            becomes radicalized in the aftermath, embarking on his own killing
            spree.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The album and concept was loosely inspired by the Japanese anime
            series Attack On Titan,” says Robb, “in the sense that in that
            series, there is no “good” or “bad” guy… There are no cowboys
            (good), no Indians (bad). Both sides believe they’re doing the right
            thing, but both are committing atrocities and evil.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Produced by Robb Flynn and long-time collaborator Zack Ohren, Of
            Kingdom And Crown is a self-evident upgrade for Machine Head and
            their ageless, epoch-shattering sound. The album begins with
            Slaughter The Martyr – a ten-minute epic, mercilessly heavy and
            brimming with wild melodic ideas, and featuring a career best vocal
            performance from Flynn himself, it sets the scene with Character
            #1’s origin story. Equally stunning are Choke On The Ashes Of Your
            Hate – simply the most brutal and intense song Machine Head have
            ever recorded – and Unhallowed: a dark, brooding and subtly
            progressive hymn for the disdained and discarded, with powerhouse
            harmony vocals from Flynn and bassist Jared McEachern. The album
            ends with arguably the finest song Machine Head have ever written:
            Arrows In Words From The Sky, the grandiose but emotionally visceral
            climax to the finest and most ferocious album of the band’s 30 year
            career.
          </p>
          <p>
            A perennially vital force in heavy music, Machine Head have
            continued their exhilarating evolution, while never losing the
            furious spirit of their old school, underground roots. Impervious to
            trends and proud to stand alone: Machine Head is still the bulldozer
            that crushes all!
